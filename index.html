            <div class="titleStyle"> SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION </div>        
            <div class="phStyle"> The New York City Police Department's policies, practices, and culture 
                perpetuate discrimination and bias against racial and ethnic minority communities, resulting in unequal 
                treatment and disproportionate impacts on these communities. Historically, the NYPD has 
                taken a hostile approach towards interacting with communities of color. The department has employed 
                discriminatory practices, including racial profiling, excessive use of force, and abuse of power, 
                that disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and other minority communities in NYC.

            <div class="titleStyle"> RACIAL <br> PROFILING</div>        
            <div class="phStyle"> Racial profiling by police in NYC refers to the practice of law enforcement 
                officers targeting individuals for suspicion or scrutiny based on their perceived race or ethnicity, rather 
                than on their behavior or evidence of wrongdoing. Racial profiling can result in disproportionate targeting 
                of individuals from specific racial or ethnic groups for stops, searches, arrests, or other forms of police action. 
                There have been numerous reports and studies that suggest racial profiling is a pervasive issue in NYC, particularly 
                affecting communities of color. The (NYPD) has faced significant scrutiny and criticism for its practices related to racial profiling.

        <div class="titleStyle"> UNEQUAL ARRESTS <br> OF POCs</div>        
        <div class="phStyle"> Individuals from Black and Hispanic communities are arrested and incarcerated at higher 
            rates compared to individuals from White and Asian communities, despite similar rates of criminal activity. 
            This pattern of disproportionate arrests is often attributed to systemic biases within the criminal justice 
            system, including racial profiling, discriminatory policing practices, and disparities in access to legal 
            representation and other resources.

        <div class="titleStyle"> ECONOMIC FACTORS</div>        
        <div class="phStyle"> Racial economic inequalities in NYC disproportionately affect 
            communities of color. These inequalities can manifest in various aspects of economic life, 
            including income, employment, education, housing, and access to financial resources. One key 
            area of racial economic inequality is income. Studies have shown that there are significant 
            wage gaps between different racial and ethnic groups in the city. Black and Hispanic workers 
            tend to earn lower wages compared to White and Asian workers, even when factors such as 
            education and experience are considered. This can result in reduced economic mobility, 
            increased poverty rates, and limited opportunities for wealth creation and financial security 
            within communities of color.
